If the parent of the grandchild dies before the grandchild process is completed ,the code is stuck in an infinite loop. 
The grandparent of the grandchild will be kept alive as the grandchild can never die (as its parent has already completed).
If the grandchild dies before its parent, the program is able to finish. 
Now the grandparent can finish execution after the parent has finished execution which in turn will occur after the grandchild dies after execution.
